## I. The "Adrian" Moment

Think about the end of the first Rocky movie. The final bell has rung. The stadium is an absolute madhouse. Reporters are shoving microphones into his face, fans are screaming, the announcer is yelling over the PA system. Rocky is a mess. He’s bleeding, his ribs are broken, and his eyes are swollen shut. He is physically blinded by the battle. People are pressing in on every side, grabbing his robe, trying to get a piece of the man who went the distance.

But Rocky isn’t listening to the reporters. He doesn’t care about the judges' scorecards. He buries his face in the roar of the thousands and screams one name: "ADRIAN!" In that moment, a stadium full of thousands of people disappears. The noise becomes silence. The camera zooms in until the crowd is a blur and only two people exist. There is only one person he is looking for. There is only one person whose presence makes that grueling, painful moment "whole" for him.

## II. The Mystery of the Crowd

During Jesus’ ministry, He lived in a "Rocky" environment every day. He was a celebrity in a world of desperate, hurting people.

Mark 3:9 tells us:

> "Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him." (NIV)

The Greek word for "crowding" (συνωστίζω, synōstizō) implies crushing or pressing. They were grabbing His sleeves, shouting His name, blocking the roads. Most were there for the "show." They wanted a miracle, a free meal, or a political revolution.

And Jesus helped many of them. But have you ever noticed how few of those thousands are actually named? We see "a large crowd," "the five thousand," "the multitudes." But then, the camera zooms in.

The Apostle Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 12 that the Kingdom is like a body. Some are hands, some are feet. Not everyone is the "face." But in the Gospels, there are people who move from being "anonymous faces in the crowd" to being "the one" Jesus stops the world for.

What is the difference between the crowd that gets a miracle and "the one" who gets a Savior?

## III. The Woman: Connection over Contact

Imagine this woman. For twelve years, she has been bleeding. In that culture, she wasn't just sick; she was unclean. She couldn't hug her children. She couldn't sit on a public bench. She had spent every penny on doctors who only made her worse. She was a ghost in her own city.

Read Mark 5:27-30, 34:

> "When the woman heard about Jesus, she came up through the crowd behind Him and touched His cloak... At once Jesus was aware that power had gone out from Him. Turning to the crowd, He asked, 'Who touched My garments?'" (BSB)

Jesus is on His way to save a dying girl. An important persons child. A "VIP" miracle. The crowd is pressing in. The disciples are acting like secret service agents, pushing people back. Then, He stops. Everything freezes. "Who touched my clothes?"

The disciples think He’s joking. "The whole city is touching you!" they say. But Jesus knew the difference between contact and connection.

The Crowd touched Him out of curiosity or accidental proximity.

The One touched Him with a specific, desperate faith that said, "If I can just reach the edge of His life, I will be changed."

She thought the power was in the garment. But Jesus looked her in the eye to show her the power was in the relationship. He used the word "Sozo" (σέσωκέν, sesōken).

In the Greek, Sozo isn't just "your skin is fixed." It is a word used for being delivered from judgment, saved, and made whole. The crowd got a touch; she got a transformation. He calls her "Daughter". She is the only woman He ever addresses this way in the Gospels.

## IV. The Leper: Gratitude as Evidence

Leprosy was a living death. Your nerves died, your skin rotted, and you were cast out of society. These ten men lived in a colony of the forgotten.

Read Luke 17:12-19:

> ​"They stood at a distance and raised their voices, shouting, 'Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!' ... When one of them saw that he was healed, he came back, praising God in a loud voice. He fell facedown at Jesus’ feet in thanksgiving to Him... And Jesus, having answered, said, 'Were not the ten cleansed? But where are the nine?'" (BSB)

All ten were obedient. All ten had enough faith to start walking toward the priest while they still had white spots on their skin. And all ten received a physical miracle. But nine of them were satisfied with the gift. They got what they wanted and went back to their lives.

Only one was captivated by the Giver.

Gratitude is the bridge that turns a blessing into a relationship.

The Nine were cured of a disease.

The One was redeemed by a Savior. Jesus tells him, "Your faith has made you whole (Sozo)." The others were physically clean, but this man was spiritually alive.

## V. Bartimaeus: Persistence over Permission

Bartimaeus is sitting in the dirt outside Jericho. He is the "background noise" of the city. A beggar. A nuisance.

Read Mark 10:47-48, 52:

> "When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, 'Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!' Many people admonished him to be silent, but he cried out all the louder... 'Go,' said Jesus, 'your faith has healed (sozo) you.'" (BSB)

The crowd tried to be a filter for Jesus. They told Bartimaeus, "You’re just a beggar. Don't trouble the Master." But Bartimaeus was like Rocky. He didn't care about the judges' scorecards or the reporters. He screamed louder!

When Jesus calls him, Bartimaeus does something symbolic: He throws off his cloak. In that day, a beggar's cloak was his "license." It was how people identified him as a legitimate beggar. By throwing it off before he could see, he was saying, "I am never going back to that identity."

Jesus doesn't just give him sight; He gives him a new path. The text says he "followed Jesus on the way." He stopped being a beggar *by* the road and became a disciple *on* the road.

## VI. The OT Connection: The Pattern of the One

This isn't a New Testament "trick." This is how God has worked for thousands of years.

Read Genesis 15:5-6:

> And the LORD took him outside and said, 'Now look to the heavens and count the stars, if you are able.'... Abram believed the LORD, and it was credited to him as righteousness." (BSB)

The world was full of people in Abraham's day. There were great kings and mighty armies. But God called one. There was no Law yet. There were no rituals or temples. There was only a promise and a man who chose to believe the Person behind the promise.

Like the woman, the leper, and the beggar, Abraham was "the one" because he responded to God’s voice with a personal trust that changed his identity. God didn't want Abraham’s "service"; He wanted his heart.

## VII. Are You in the Crowd?

We live in a "crowd" culture. We show up to church, we "press in" on Jesus, we say the prayers, and we hope for a "gumball" miracle. Put in a prayer, get out a result.

But Jesus is looking for the "Adrian" moment. He is looking for the one who:

- Reaches out for Connection, not just a fix.
- Returns in Worship, not just satisfaction.
- Refuses to be Silenced by the world’s expectations.

Read Ephesians 2:8-9:

> "For it is by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not from yourselves; it is the gift of God,not as a result of works, so that no one may boast." (BSB)

You can't work your way into being "the one." You can't buy your way out of the crowd. It is a gift of grace, received through the kind of faith we see in the woman, the leper, and Bartimaeus.

## VIII. The Call to Action & Closing Prayer

What is keeping you in the crowd today?

- Is it fear? (The Woman)
- Is it entitlement? (The Nine Lepers)
- Is it your old cloak? (Bartimaeus)

This week, don't just be "religious." Don't just brush against Jesus on Sunday morning. Be the one who stops Him. Be the one who returns. Be the one who cries out until the world falls silent and it's just you and Him.

Maybe you've never really stopped to cry out to Jesus, to throw off your old cloak, to follow Him on the way. This week, why don't youtake a step. Be the one.

Closing Prayer:

"Lord, we thank You that You are not a God who is overwhelmed by the crowd. We confess that often we want Your hands, but not Your heart. Like Bartimaeus, give us the courage to throw off our old cloaks. Transform us today from a crowd into a people who follow You 'on the way.' We don't just want to be healed; we want to be Sozo—made whole in You. Amen."
