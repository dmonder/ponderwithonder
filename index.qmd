This is my personal blog. In it, I will share thoughts that intrigue me. Sometimes they will be related to Christ, the one who rules my life. Other times, they will be related to my work. I am currently the director of Institutional Excellence, Research, and Grants at Haywood Community College. At work, my interests include institutional research, assessment, Power BI, Quarto, R, and Python. 

Enjoy!
